> Calculate the value of guildwars2 accounts

## Install

```
npm install gw2e-account-value
```

This module can be used for Node.js as well as browsers using [Browserify](https://github.com/substack/browserify-handbook#how-node_modules-works).

## Calculations

### Defining "value"

> **The value of an item should roughly represent how much money/effort a new player would need to get that item.**

1. If the item is currently sold in the tradingpost, then the **sell price** is used
2. If the item is currently not sold in the tradingpost, then the greater of the **last known sell price** and the **crafting price** is used
3. If the item was never sold and cannot be crafted, then the **buy price** is used
4. If the item has no tradingpost price and cannot be crafted, then the **vendor price** is used

```js
const value = require('gw2e-account-value')

let item = {
  id: 1, 
  sell: {price: 1337, last_known: 1337}, 
  buy: {price: 12, last_known: 12}, 
  crafting: {buy: 10000}, 
  vendor_price: 5
  // ...
}

let value = value.itemValue(item)
// -> 1337
```

### Untradable items

Some items (like the "Permanent Merchant Express" or the "Miniature Gwynefyrdd") are account-bound and therefore don't have a tradingpost price. Instead, they inherit the value of tradable containers they are included in or items that can be traded for them.

```js
const value = require('gw2e-account-value')

let item = {id: 1, /* ... */}
let itemInheritance = value.itemInherits(item.id)
// -> {id: 12: count: 1}
// -> {id: 5, count: 100, gold: 10000}
// -> {gold: 1000000}
// -> false for items that don't inherit value from other items
```

### Containers

Arguably all containers hold a value, but since it can be completely random how much a container is actually worth and the effort of maintaining a list of container to item mappings is not justified, containers without a tradingpost price are ignored.

The one exception to this are ascended boxes, which use the average value across all ascended items as a rough estimate.

### Skins

Single skins can be acquired from a lot of items most of the time. The value of a skins is therefore the value of the cheapest item unlocking the skin. *(Note: An exception is "Eternity", which is worth nothing, since it unlocks the skin of "Sunrise" & "Twilight" and should not count twice)*

When calculating the total account value, skins only have a value if the account has no item of this skin in their inventory, so they don't count twice.

### Gemstore items

:construction: **This is not supported yet.** :construction:

While a lot of gemstore items are acquired for free from dailies or events, they definitely hold a value. This value is the default gem price (without taking sales into account) at the current gold to gem conversion rate.

```js
const value = require('gw2e-account-value')

// Note: for things like character slots and bank slots, the
// unlock item id should get passed in
let item = {id: 1, /* ... */}
let gemPrice = value.itemGems(item.id)
// -> 123
// -> false for non-gemstore items
```

### Wallet

:construction: **This is not supported yet.** :construction:

Every currency in the wallet is valued at the currently best *permanent* conversion rate.

- **Gold:** Direct value
- **Spirit Shards:** Best conversion excluding weapons (since they don't sell fast and usually require dungeon tokens as well)
- **Dungeon Tokens:** Best conversion rate excluding items needing account bound recipes and weapons
- **Gems:** Current gems to gold conversion rate
- **Laurels:** Best conversion excluding once-per-account items
- **Karma / Badges of Honor / Guild Commendations / Claim Tickets:** Best conversion rate

### Achievements

:construction: **This is not supported yet.** :construction:

The value of an achievement equals the value of all unlock items this achievement requires, but *excluding the value of items still owned by the account*.

### Crafting professions

:construction: **This is not supported yet.** :construction:

The value of a crafting profession equals the cost of leveling the crafting profession to that rating.

## (TODO) Deploy timeline

### v1

- [ ] Deploy this into gw2-api and set a new "value" key
- [ ] Expose a new /items/all-values endpoint `{id: 1, price: 12, value: 12}`
- [ ] Use the value key for skin prices
- [ ] Flip the legacy backend to ues /items/all-values instead of prices
- [ ] Turn off the "custom item prices" command and endpoint (& remove from gw2api)
- [ ]Â Show value in item tooltips

### v2

- [ ] Update this module to be able to calculate everything if you pass it an account
- [ ] Use the module in the frontend and backend

### v2.1 - v2.4

- [ ] Include all the "under construction" points

## Tests

```
npm test
```
